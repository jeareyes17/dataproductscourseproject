## Background

The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC). 



## Variables used

```{r ToothGrowth, echo = TRUE}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

## Shiny Application

The link to the application is indicated:
